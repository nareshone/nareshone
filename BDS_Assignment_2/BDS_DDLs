Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much �climbing the mountain� that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.   In this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the �cloud� using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless� Really!   �But wait�, you will say, �there is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.� Great point! But what if� instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? �Ok, but that�s probably very complicated�, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!"	language  github  web  unit testing  ruby (programming language)  rubygems  ruby on rails  Web Development  rspec  Computer Programming computer-science mobile-and-web-development
